# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Customer-Reviews

Nowadays customer feedback is like gold for businesses! Whether it’s a restaurant, hotel, or a website design company, reviews give businesses a clear picture of how their customers feel about their products or services. But with so many reviews coming in daily basis, it’s nearly impossible to read and understand all of them manually. That’s where AI-powered sentiment analysis steps in to save the day. It automates the process, turning all those words into meaningful insights businesses can act on.

My goal is to create an automated AI solution that will analyze the customer reviews, and will classify them as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These types of approach is super useful for e-commerce, and it also works well for other industries like retail, hospitality, healthcare, and finance too. 
So what this Sentiment analysis will do-it will takes all that customer feedback and breaks it down those text into clear insights, so that businesses can quickly understand what their customers need and what decisions to be taken to make their experience better.
